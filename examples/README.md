# Discussion

For this assignment, we only discuss between ourselves. We've both equally wrote
the test cases.

Wahid more focused on expression, precedence, grouping testing. Pranjal focused on the function, variable, assignment testing.

Moreover, report was written by both us. Wahid wrote the report "Design.pdf" and Pranjal wrote the report 
"Specification.pdf".
